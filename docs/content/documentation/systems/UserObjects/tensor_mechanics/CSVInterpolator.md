# CSVInterpolator

!syntax description /UserObjects/CSVInterpolator

## Description
`CSVInterpolator` reads all csv files with a given pattern. The position vector in the `from_component` direction is extracted from the csv files along with data corresponding to a list of variables. The time vector is either read in from a seperate `time_file` or is calculated using a constant `time_step`. With the position, time and variable values, a bilinear interpolation object is constructed for each variable. This interpolation object can be used by other classes such as [ComputeBeamEigenstrainFromCSVInterpolator](/ComputeBeamEigenstrainFromCSVInterpolator,md) to calculate the variable values at a given quadrature point at a given time.
