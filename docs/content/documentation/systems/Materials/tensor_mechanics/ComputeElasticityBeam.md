#ComputeElasticityBeam

!syntax description /Materials/ComputeElasticityBeam

## Description
This class computes the elasticity vectors (material stiffness and flexure) for the beam element which relates the displacement and rotational strain increments to forces and moments increments, respectively. Please refer to [C0TimoshenkoBeam](/C0TimoshenkoBeam.md) for details.
